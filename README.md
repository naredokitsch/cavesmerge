THIS IS A PRETTY ROUGH VERSION OF A 3D IMAGES MERGING PROGRAM
IT WAS WRITTEN AT FIRST AS A DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT I AM THINKING TO DO

THE LOGIC IS COMPARE THE MOST EXTERNAL COOSDINATED PLANES OF BOTH IMAGES AND FIND AT LEAST 2 POINTS SIMILAR IN BOTH IMAGES TO JOIN THEM TOGETHER.

THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF A BUNNY. YOU NEED A PLY VIEWER PROGRAM TO SEE THERE IS A SPLITTED BUNNY.

THE WAY TO RUN THE PROGRAM IS:

$ ./merge.sh bunnyhead.ply bunnytail.ply output_name_file.ply

YOU NEED A PLY VIEWER TO SEE THE RESULTS.
