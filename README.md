THIS IS A PRETTY ROUGH VERSION OF A 3D CAVES MERGING PROGRAM
IT WAS WRITTEN AT FIRST AS A DEMONSTRATION
IT IS ROUGH BECAUSE IS VERY LIMMTED
AND DINN'T USE THREAD AS SHOULD BE

IT IS LIMITED TO FIND AT LEAST 2 POINTS IN IN SIMILAR PLANES OF BOTH IMAGES

THE WAY TO USE IT IS TO RUN MERGE PROGRAM WITH THE OTHER THREE PROGRAMS IN THE SAME FOLDER
THE WAY TO RUN IT IS WRITING THE TWO FILES AND A NEW NAME TO MERGE AFTER MERGE PROGRAM
